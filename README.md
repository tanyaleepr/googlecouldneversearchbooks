## Description

This is a MERN app with GraphQL and Apollo Server on the back-end. The search uses Google's Book API to search, find, and save your favorite books with their title, authors, description, image, and a link to the book on Google. 

A live version of the app can be found on [Heroku](https://fast-chamber-65304.herokuapp.com//).
